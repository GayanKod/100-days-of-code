# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 01: September 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I solved a Hackerrank Algorithm >> Greedy Question, which is called Sherlock & the beast, I spend 3.5 hours for this. And also I dicovered some weak points of that question. 

**Thoughts:** I spend so many times to start today coding, but when I start it, I do it continuously, actually I don't even need to take the dinner. I really struggle first in that question. but I took a coffee break and think it again.. finally I could come up with the solution using python 3. I realize some weak points on that question also, so then I code the algorithm to match those bugs and I got full points finally ;)

### Day 03: September 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a Medium type Greedy Question for a Hackerrank Platform based competition. Since this is a competition, I cannot public the code or the question. To create this algorithm, I used python 3. And this question about a Investigation of a Sherlock Holmes. 

**Thoughts:** This question based on a story of Sherlock. I hope this will be very interest in competitors. I am also a Sherlock Holmes fan. That's why I make this question based on a Sherlock's story.
